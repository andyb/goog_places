## Synopsis

This is a hack to test out if we can use google maps to lookup place names so they're not manually entered. 

This is hacked together quickly to POC so please ignore the mess. It does work.

## How to run

Clone the repo and navigate to that in terminal.

From there `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` 

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

and

`http://localhost:8000/auto_com.html`

Experience the magic...
